I found that the class ULLMap is the slowest(0.27 sec for only 10000 insertions), and it does not allow me to insert large number of strings. BSTMap is fast, but the Java’s Built-in TreeMap is the fastest. For 10,000,000 insertions, my class BSTMap took 10.35 sec and Java’s TreeMap only took 8.38 sec.

Running InsertInOrderSpeedTest, I found that the insertion speed is much lower for both ULLMap and BSTMap, but Java’s TreeMap and HashMap still perform fast insertion.
